# R PivotTable for Power BI
Interactive R HTML Pivot Table for Microsoft Power BI from David Eldersveld.

### PREVIEW
R PivotTable is in early *preview*. You can download **RPivotTable-1.0.1.pbiviz** for testing in non-production environments from the [*packaged-versions*](https://github.com/BlueGranite/RPivotTable-for-Power-BI/tree/master/packaged-versions) folder in this repository. There is no support currently offered for this visual while in preview, but please log any problems in the Issues section of this repository. 

### Use
R PivotTable for Power BI is an interactive R HTML visual that relies on R's *rpivotTable* package. This package is currently not available in the Power BI Service at www.powerbi.com. I have made a request to have Microsoft install the package per the instructions in their [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-r-packages-support). In the meantime, this custom visual is limited to use in Power BI Desktop connecting to a local R environment with both the *htmlwidgets* and *rpivotTable* packages installed.
